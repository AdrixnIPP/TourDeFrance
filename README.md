 # Tour de France Data Analysis Project with Machine Learning Techniques

### Introduction
 The Tour de France is one of the world's oldest and most prestigious cycling competitions. 
 This project aims to analyze historical data from the Tour de France, including winners, stages and race results. 
 We will use Machine Learning techniques to explore this data, identify trends and possibly predict certain future results.

### Project objectives
 1. Analyze historical data of Tour de France winners.
 2. Explore stage and results data for each rider.
 3. Use Machine Learning techniques to predict specific results such as total time for a winner or number of stage wins.
 4. Visualize data and results from Machine Learning models.

 ### Project stages
 
 The project stages we'll be working on are as follows:
 1. Data Import and Preparation
 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 3. Data Preparation for Machine Learning
 4. Modeling and Prediction
 5. Model Evaluation
 6. Conclusion and Openings
